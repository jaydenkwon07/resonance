class_name RoomGeometry
extends RefCounted
## Pure positional maths for a room (M6 Step 2a, extracted from room.gd). No nodes, no
## signals, no engine state — just tile→world arithmetic, so it is unit-testable under
## --script and is the single source of truth for the numbers a room places content by.
## `RockAtlas`/`Door`/`SealedDoor` reference EnvPalette and cannot compile under --script;
## this deliberately does not touch them, so it stays testable (the pure-seam discipline,
## CLAUDE.md §4).
##
## Constructed with the finalised tile size and room extent; `room.gd` builds one after the
## TileSet reports its tile size back (§5.2).

## Tiles inside from a gated link its door leaf sits (§6.4, M5 Step 5a). 1.5 centres the leaf
## in its two-tile reserved footprint; a float so it lands between the footprint's two cells.
const DOOR_INSET := 1.5
## A plain transition entry lands 1 tile inside the destination's mirrored edge (Undertale).
const ENTRY_INSET := 1
## A DOORED link lands the player DOOR_ENTRY_INSET in — clear of the leaf's slab, room-side of
## the open door they came through (5a). Sized to the slab.
const DOOR_ENTRY_INSET := 3.5
## The edge-band exit trigger's thickness across the boundary (Undertale transitions).
const EDGE_TRIGGER_THICKNESS := 24.0
