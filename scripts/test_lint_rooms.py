"""Fixture tests for lint_rooms (M6 Step 2b) — one per rule, proving it fires.

Uses the real room_a as a known-good baseline, then mutates a copy to trip each rule and
asserts the matching message appears. Run:

    python3 scripts/test_lint_rooms.py

Exit non-zero on any failure, like the other Python tools. Stdlib only, no pytest (repo style).
