## Runtime polyphonic synth (§7.1).
##
## Generates tones with AudioStreamGenerator rather than playing sample files:
## pitch comes from NoteNames.to_frequency(), so tuning is exact by construction
## and nothing needs re-recording when the palette changes. Real instrument
## samples can replace this later behind NoteBus — listeners never know.
##
## Godot note: AudioStreamGenerator hands us a raw playback buffer. We push
## audio frames into it ourselves each _process; mixing all voices in one buffer
## (rather than one AudioStreamPlayer per voice) is what lets us scale the sum
## to prevent clipping, which the per-player bus mixer could not do for us.
##
## Audio always plays, even in the instrument state (§6): this deliberately does
## NOT check NoteBus.effects_enabled() — only gameplay effects do.
##
## Tuned in M1. Three invariants here are load-bearing, not arbitrary — don't break them:
## - The mix is divided by the SQUARE ROOT of the active voice count. Without it, five
##   simultaneous notes exceed full scale and clip; dividing by the count instead would make a
##   chord quieter than a single note. The divisor is eased so a starting or ending voice
##   doesn't jump the scale of notes already sounding.
## - Voice cleanup checks `env <= 0.0 AND age >= attack`. The age check is not redundant: a
##   fade reading 0.0 at the START of an attack looks like 0.0 at the END of a decay, and
##   testing the value alone once freed every voice on its first sample (the envelope bug).
## - BUFFER_LENGTH is 0.04s, a deliberate latency-vs-dropout trade. Lower for more snap at the
##   risk of crackle; don't change it incidentally.
## The waveform itself is a plain sine and IS arbitrary — a placeholder for the instrument
## voices the owner composes later. Swapping it is expected; do it behind NoteBus so nothing
## else changes.

const MIX_RATE := 44100.0
## Seconds of generator buffer. This is the play-to-hear latency: _process
## keeps the buffer full, so a new note waits behind whatever is already queued.
## It is also the dropout margin — the buffer must outlast one frame (~16ms at
## 60fps) or it empties between fills and crackles. 40ms trades a safe ~2.4
## frames of headroom for a responsive feel. Lower toward ~0.02 if the machine
## holds it without crackle; raise if you hear dropouts.
