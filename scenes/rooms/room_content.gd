class_name RoomContent
extends RefCounted
## Instances a room's content nodes from data (M6 Step 2a, extracted from room.gd) so new
## content types stop growing room.gd — the same move that produced door_gems/door_art. It
## owns instancing ONLY: every placement number comes from the RoomGeometry it is handed, and
## each node is added as a child of the room. It references Door/Prop/NotePickup/… (which in
## turn reference EnvPalette), so like room.gd it does not compile under --script; the maths it
## leans on is tested through RoomGeometry.


## Decorative detail props (M5 Step 5e): rubble piles. No collision or light — placed on floor
## for look only, so they never affect the frozen geometry, the validator or the seal test. The
## cell seeds the deterministic shape.

## Decorative sealed doors (§7.5, M5 Step 5c): unopenable five-note doors with no link, melody
## or lock. Placed from a 2-tile opening exactly like a real door (DOOR_INSET + opening
## centring), so they land in the same reserved footprint and read as the same family. The
## opening is a perimeter one, or with an explicit `facing` an interior recess (the Resonance
## core's boss door, until M12 gives it a real one).

## A gated link's door leaf, sitting DOOR_INSET tiles inside from the link and blocking the
