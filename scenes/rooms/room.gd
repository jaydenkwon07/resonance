class_name Room
extends Node2D
## A room built from data (§6.3, Fork B / D-M3-1). Reads its geometry from RoomGraph
## (data/rooms/<room_id>.json), paints a TileMapLayer with collision from the shared TileSet —
## never per-wall StaticBody2Ds (§2) — and instances the room's contents: transition links,
## note pickups, clue chimes, decorative props/sealed doors, and the doors that gate some
## links.
##
## [M6 Step 2a] The positional maths lives in the pure, unit-tested `RoomGeometry`, and content
## instancing in `RoomContent`, so this file stays orchestration + tile painting + link wiring
## and stops growing every time a content type is added. Numbers are unchanged from M5 — the
## Cistern's LOCKED geometry is preserved.
##
## `transition_requested` is forwarded up from the room's RoomLinks so World can drive the room
## swap without being globally addressable (§6.2, §6.4).

# --- Tiles ---

## Floor cells are painted directly with a spatial-hash variant; rock cells are handed to Godot's
## terrain system, which picks the blob tile per cell from its neighbourhood (M5 Step 1). A
## one-cell rock ring is added outside the grid so the room's outer perimeter reads as solid rock
## rather than bevelling into the void — those ring cells sit beyond the camera clamp and behind
## the perimeter wall, so the player never sees or reaches them.
##
## [M7] Under `--walls=smooth` the rock comes from RoomWalls' smoothed loops instead; the TileSet
## is still built, for its tile size and its floor/rock art.

## position. A doored link lands the player room-side of the leaf, not in it (5a).
