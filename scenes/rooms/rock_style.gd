class_name RockStyle
extends Resource
## Tunable look of the cave (M5 Step 2b). The tuning surface for the whole
## cave: `room.gd` holds one of these (or the defaults) and hands it to
## RockAtlas.build and RoomWalls. Edit the values here, assign a `.tres`, or tweak them in the
## inspector — none of it is baked into the drawing code.
##
## Colours are EnvPalette NAMES, never hex (§3, the one rule's environment
## corollary); an unknown name resolves to magenta so a typo shows. Tiles stay FLAT
## (no baked directional light — the PointLights do that, §8a). The value gap below
## is the deliverable: floor reads LIGHTER than rock so the room is legible without
## leaning on the outline (reference: dark walls, a lifted floor).

## Floor base — one to two ramp steps LIGHTER than the rock body (~1.7× its
## brightness is a starting point, spec 2b).
@export var floor_tone: String = "rock_shadow"
## Rock body base — dark, so outcrops and walls recede against the floor.
@export var rock_tone: String = "rock_deep"
## The wall-meets-floor rim: the darkest tone, drawn on the wall outline.
@export var seam_tone: String = "rock_void"

## Width in px of the dark rim RoomWalls draws on every wall loop (straddling the edge).
## 0 removes the rim.
@export_range(0.0, 6.0, 0.1) var seam_px: float = 2.0
## Facet grit density per tile (flat value variation, not a light gradient).
@export_range(0, 16) var rock_facet_count: int = 5
